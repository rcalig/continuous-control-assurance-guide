# Evidence Strategy (Week 2)

## Principles
- Evidence must be machine-generated (no screenshots)
- Evidence must be replayable (time-series, not point-in-time)
- Evidence must be attributable (source + timestamp + collector version)
- Evidence must be complete enough to evaluate assertions deterministically

## Evidence Types
- configuration_state
- identity_inventory
- patch_inventory
- audit_events

## Evidence Cadence
- daily (configuration and inventories)
- continuous (audit events and high-risk changes)

## What is NOT evidence
- screenshots
- emails
- meeting notes
- “approved” or “reviewed” statements without technical verification
